# LTC Wallet — live MWEB end-to-end checklist

Operator checklist for proving v0.2 MWEB against a live archive peer + litecoind RPC.
Library-level loops live in the sibling BDK repo ([`LITECOIN_E2E.md`](../../bdk/docs/LITECOIN_E2E.md),
[`MWEB_PEER_OPS.md`](../../bdk/docs/MWEB_PEER_OPS.md)). This document is the **desktop product** gate.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Archive litecoind with MWEB + LIP-0006 (`initialblockdownload=false`, P2P accepting peers)
- [ ] JSON-RPC reachable (cookie or `user:pass` URL) — required for pure MWEB broadcast fallback
- [ ] Electrum-LTC reachable for transparent sync
- [ ] Fresh test wallet (or throwaway amounts) on the target network
- [ ] App Settings: MWEB peer(s) and Litecoin RPC URL configured; Sync succeeds

## Broadcast identity rules

- Transparent / peg-in (hybrid): track **txid**; litview deep links OK when chain txid.
- Pure MWEB send / peg-out: track **wtxid** (empty-skeleton `txid` collides). App result modal shows the id returned by `wallet-core`.
- If Electrum rejects MWEB payloads (“decode failed”), RPC/P2P path must succeed with humanized Settings CTA.

## Checklist

### 1. Transparent baseline

- [ ] Create or restore wallet; backup quiz / unlock works
- [ ] Sync: status strip shows Electrum tip; no persistent error
- [ ] Receive Public → fund small amount → appears after sync (pending then confirmed)

### 2. Peg-in (Public → Private)

- [ ] Swap → Move to private; preview shows miner fee + MWEB fee
- [ ] Broadcast succeeds (txid); History shows peg-in **maturing** until 6 confs
- [ ] Combined balance: maturing vs spendable Private correct
- [ ] Optional: coin control selection + freeze respected

### 3. Private send (MWEB → MWEB)

- [ ] After maturity, Send Private to a known stealth address (or self)
- [ ] Result id is **wtxid**; success copy does not imply explorer lookup
- [ ] Balance updates after sync; no silent zeroing

### 4. Peg-out (Private → Public)

- [ ] Swap → Move to public; broadcast via P2P and/or RPC
- [ ] Transparent balance increases after HogEx credit visible to Electrum sync
- [ ] History labels peg-out correctly

### 5. Failure recovery (must pass)

- [ ] With RPC cleared and peers unreachable: private send/peg-out failure opens recovery modal → Settings Connection
- [ ] Mempool conflict / already-known messages point to Sync + History Pending (no RBF UI)
- [ ] After fixing RPC/peers, retry succeeds

### 6. Record the run

Fill in when green:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Network | mainnet / testnet |
| Electrum tip | |
| MWEB synced height | |
| Peg-in txid | |
| Private send wtxid | |
| Peg-out wtxid | |
| litecoind version / peer | |
| App version / git SHA | |
| Date | |

## Exit criteria (M1)

This checklist is green on at least one live network (testnet preferred for dogfood; mainnet with dust amounts OK). Packaging/notarization is a separate M1 track — see [`VERIFYING.md`](VERIFYING.md).

## Out of scope here

Fine-window sync UI, embedded litecoind, mwebd, hardware wallets, Tor.
